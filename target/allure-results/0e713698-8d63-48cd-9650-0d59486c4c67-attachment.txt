# API Test Analysis Report

## Overall Summary:
A total of **10 unique APIs** were tested, all of which returned a **100% success rate (200 status codes)**. These tests included endpoints for authentication and user management, validating both CRUD operations and session management functionalities. Performance metrics indicate timely responses across all requests.

## Key Issues:
- No errors encountered: All requests returned successful status codes (200).

## Technical Root Cause Insights:
- N/A: There were no failures or errors logged in this testing round to analyze.

## Suggestions:
- **Add Validation Checks**: Implement input validation logic for future API interactions.
- **Simulate Edge Cases**: Create tests that include potential edge cases to ensure robustness (e.g., unsupported methods, invalid tokens).
- **Enhance Logging**: Include more granular logging (e.g., timestamps, request payloads) for better traceability during future tests.

## Endpoints Tested:
- **POST /api/auth/register → 200** | User registration successful
- **POST /api/auth/login → 200** | User login successful, token issued
- **GET /api/auth/check → 200** | Authentication status check successful
- **GET /api/auth/logout → 200** | Logout operation successful
- **GET /api/auth/users → 200** | User list retrieved successfully
- **POST /api/auth/forgot-username → 200** | Username recovery email sent successfully
- **POST /api/auth/reset-password → 200** | Password reset operation successful
- **GET /api/auth/profile/admin_1762719422116 → 200** | User profile retrieval successful

- **GET /api/dashboard/stats → 200** | Dashboard statistics retrieved successfully
- **GET /api/admin/gemini/users → 200** | Admin user list retrieved successfully
- **GET /api/users/1 → 200** | Specific user data retrieval successful
- **DELETE /api/users/1 → 200** | User deletion successful

## Error Breakdown:
- No endpoints returned non-200 status codes during this testing phase. 

This testing cycle demonstrated effective API functionality across all tested endpoints without any reported issues. Further testing can focus on edge scenarios to ensure comprehensive coverage and resilience.
